# The game of Carcassonne

## Introduction

The game of Carcassonne is a tile based board game normally played by 2 to 5 players.

## Game mechanics

The game starts with a default start tile that includes a castle and a road.

### Game supplies/materials

The game tiles consist of castles, roads, fields and monasteries. There are 72 terrain tiles in the game including the river tiles. The game also includes meeples in 5 different colors.

### Round

A round consists of a player randomly selecting a tile and placing it adjacent to another tile already placed. No tile, except the starting tile, can be placed surrounded by no other tiles. After the player has placed the tile he/she has the option to place a meeple on the road or castle of that particular tile. A player can not place a meeple on a road or castle that already has a meeple placed on it.

### Scoring

Each road is worth one point. If the road a meeple is placed on is closed at both ends, the player can retrieve his/her meeple. Road points are calculated either at the time a meeple is returned to the player or at the end of the game if the roads haven't been closed by that time. If multiple players have meeples on the same road, the player with the maximum number of meeples gets the points. If all players have an equal amount of meeples on the same road every player gets the same number of points.

Each castle is worth one point. Each barricade on the castle is worth an additional one point. If a castle is fully closed the points a player receives for that castle double and the player retrieves his/her meeple. Points are calculated either when the castle is closed or at the end of the game if the castle is not closed.

TODO:
+ include a map of all the individual tiles under game materials
+ Use rivers and fields as game extensions and for extra ways to score points.
